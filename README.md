This project was started as a capstone project for General Assembly's Web Development program.  

The problem this website is to solve is keeping track of all permanent mural artists and locations around the city of Atlanta.

Users have the option of logging into a distinct profile and viewing all their saved artists and locations.  

Users will eventually be able to add their locations to a map with icon for precise location.
